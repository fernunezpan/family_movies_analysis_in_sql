In this project we explore data patterns on movies that families watch.

QUESTIONS WE ANSWER
- How rental of family-friendly movies compares to the duration of all rented movies 

- How two given stores compare each other on their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data

- Who were our top 10 paying customers, how many payments they made on a monthly basis during 2007, and what was the amount of the monthly payments

RESULTS and CHARTS are detailed in the attached pdf
